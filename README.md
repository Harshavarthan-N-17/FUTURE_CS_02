# Password Analyzer Tool 🔐

This is a **Python-based password strength analyzer** that evaluates passwords based on length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides **strength feedback** and **suggestions** for improving weak passwords. Additionally, it generates the **SHA-256 hash** of the entered password.

✔️ Provides **suggestions** to improve weak passwords  
✔️ Displays password **strength with color indicators**  
✔️ Option to **show/hide password** input  
✔️ Generates **SHA-256 hash** of the password
